Try to read books that gives details about trading systems such as darvas box , turtle traders.. But the most powerfull of all knowledges after reading all the books is your power of observation of charts .. avoid applying mot a mot what they say or what they .. Look for the zones where traders are trapped in the market and they are trying to get out . Look for this zones to be close at the extreme of the active trading range (higher timeframe HH LL). Combine it with the smaller TF active range HH and LL. Try to see what other trader see , not only your analysis. Wait fot the setup to come , hours , even days .
React to the market movement in those zones ,
DO NOT PREDICT what the market will do , just react and scale in after the setup comes into play
