Look for the zones where traders are trapped in the market and they are trying to get out . Look for this zones to be close at the extreme of the active trading range (higher timeframe HH LL). Combine it with the smaller TF active range HH and LL. Try to see what other trader see , not only your analysis. Wait fot the setup to come , hours , even days .
